The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'object_detection'` indicates that the `object_detection` module from the **TensorFlow Object Detection API** is not available in your environment. To fix this issue, you need to set up the **TensorFlow Object Detection API** correctly.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue:

#### 1. **Clone the TensorFlow Models Repository**
First, you need to clone the **TensorFlow models** repository, which contains the `object_detection` module.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
```

#### 2. **Install Dependencies**
After cloning the repository, you need to install the required dependencies for the Object Detection API.

1. Navigate to the `models/research/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd models/research/
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   You may need to install the following packages to set up the TensorFlow Object Detection API:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install pillow
   pip install lxml
   pip install jupyter
   pip install pandas
   pip install opencv-python
   pip install cython
   pip install contextlib2
   pip install tf-slim
   pip install py-cpuinfo
   ```

3. **Install the Object Detection API**:
   Now, you can install the Object Detection API by running the following command in the `models/research/` directory:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

   This command will install the package from the current directory (`.`), which is the root directory of the cloned TensorFlow models repository.

#### 3. **Check if the Installation is Successful**
To check if the installation was successful, try running the following test script from the `models/research/` directory:

```bash
python object_detection/builders/model_builder_test.py
```

If everything is set up correctly, this test should pass without any errors.

#### 4. **Use the Object Detection API in Your Script**
Once you've installed the Object Detection API, you should be able to import the `label_map_util` and `object_detection` modules in your script without encountering the `ModuleNotFoundError`.

```python
from object_detection.utils import label_map_util
```

### Alternative: If You Don’t Want to Clone the Entire Repository
If you don’t want to clone the whole TensorFlow models repository, you can install the TensorFlow Object Detection API directly by following the steps here: [TensorFlow Object Detection API Installation](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
